<p style="font-size:30px">Weather and Climate Datasets for AI Research</p>


Welcome to this collection of weather and climate datasets for AI research. In the last few years more and more datasets are being published. This website is an attempt at providing an overview of what's available.

The datasets are split into datasets [specifically processed for AI]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link preprocessed_datasets.markdown %}) research and commonly used [raw datasets]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link raw_datasets.markdown %}). 

If you know of a dataset that is not already on the list, you can contribute in two ways:

1. Go to the Github repository of this site, clone it, add your paper and create a pull request.
2. Create an issue in this Github repository with the details of the paper and one of us will add the dataset.
